                                              Unittests and Integration Tests
Introduction
Testing is a critical part of software development. It ensures that your code works as expected,
and it helps to catch any bugs or errors before the code is deployed into production. There are different types of tests,
but the two most common types are unit tests and integration tests.

Unittests
Unit tests are tests that are written to test individual pieces of code, such as functions, methods, or classes.
They are designed to be small, fast, and isolated from other code. The goal of unit tests is to ensure that each individual piece of code works correctly.

Python has a built-in module called unittest that makes it easy to write and run unit tests.
You can create test cases that check the output of functions or methods against expected values. For example:

```import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAdd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()```

In this example, we have defined a function add that adds two numbers together. We have also defined a test case TestAdd that tests the add function using the assertEqual method.
The assertEqual method checks whether the output of the add function is equal to the expected value. If any of the assertions fail, the test case will fail.

You can run the test case by running the script. If all the assertions pass, the test case will pass. If any of the assertions fail, the test case will fail.

                                            Integration Tests
Integration tests are tests that test how different pieces of code work together. They are designed to test the integration points between different pieces of code.
Integration tests are typically slower and more complex than unit tests.

In Python, integration tests are often run using test runners such as pytest or nose. These test runners make it easy to run multiple test cases and to generate reports.
An example of an integration test might be a test case that tests a web application by simulating user interactions. For example:

```import unittest
from selenium import webdriver

class TestWebApp(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get('http://localhost:5000')

    def test_login(self):
        self.driver.find_element_by_name('username').send_keys('user')
        self.driver.find_element_by_name('password').send_keys('password')
        self.driver.find_element_by_name('login').click()

        assert 'Welcome' in self.driver.page_source

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, we are using the selenium package to simulate a user logging in to a web application.
We are checking that the word 'Welcome' appears in the page source after the user logs in. This test case tests the integration between the login page,
the login functionality, and the home page.
